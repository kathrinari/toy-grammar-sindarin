# toy-grammar-sindarin
University project on building a computational grammar with XLE, based on Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG). 

The XLE Web Interface (XLE-Web) is a web-based tool for parsing with LFG grammars and viewing c-structures and f-structures. (For further information on XLE, see: https://clarino.uib.no/iness/page?page-id=XLE-Web_Documentation )

Outline of this project was to create a toy grammar consisting of most of the relevant grammatical/morphosyntactical features of a chosen language. The target language for this grammar is the fictional language Sindarin, invented by J.R.R. Tolkien. 

The Sindarin XLE Grammar tokenizes and parses sentences based on rules and templates, which were defined by me after analyzing the language morphosyntactically. Phonological features were taken into account, hence they tend to affect the morphological structure of words.
